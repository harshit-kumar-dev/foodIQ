## 🔥 Core Features

Our application provides a suite of tools to revolutionize how you interact with food packaging:

### 1. 🔍 Real-Time OCR & Barcode Scanning
Leveraging advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the app instantly extracts ingredient lists from any food product. No more squinting at tiny fonts on the back of a pack.

### 2. 🛡️ Personalized Health Guard
The most powerful feature of the app. It doesn't just list ingredients; it checks them against **your** health conditions. 
- **Diabetes:** Automatically flags high-glycemic ingredients.
- **Hypertension:** Alerts on excessive sodium content.
- **Allergies:** Instantly identifies hidden allergens.

### 3. 📊 Interactive Nutri-Score
Get an immediate visual health grade (A to E) for any product. Our algorithm breaks down why a product received its score, highlighting both the positive (fiber, protein) and negative (saturated fats, sugars) contributors.

### 4. 💡 AI-Powered Alternatives
If a product is deemed "Unhealthy" or "Risky," the app doesn't just stop there. it suggests **Better Alternatives** available in the market that align with your health goals.

### 5. 📉 Daily Sugar & Health Tracker
Keep a running log of your consumption. The app tracks your daily sugar intake through an interactive dashboard, helping you stay within recommended health limits.

### 6. 👥 Family Health Management
Create and switch between multiple profiles (e.g., Mom, Dad, Kids). Each profile has unique health conditions, ensuring the whole family stays safe.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture Overview

The system is split into two main layers designed for scalability and speed.

### 🌐 Frontend (Client-Side)
The frontend is a modern **React SPA** built for performance.
- **Components:** Modular UI elements for scanning, tracking, and analysis.
- **State Management:** Real-time feedback loops for scan results and profile updates.
- **Design:** A premium "Glassmorphism" theme optimized for both desktop and mobile.

### ⚙️ Backend (Server-Side)
A robust **Node.js/Express** environment that handles the "intelligence" of the app.
- **Intelligence Engine:** Processes raw text into structured ingredient data.
- **Database:** Secure storage for user profiles and comprehensive ingredient hazard lists.
- **API Services:** Dedicated routes for authentication, scanning history, and product comparison.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone & Enter:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd internal/frontend
   ```

2. **Install:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 💡 How it Works

1. **Scan:** Point your camera at an ingredient label or barcode.
2. **Analyze:** The backend identifies additives and cross-references them with hazard databases.
3. **Compare:** Results are filtered through your personal health conditions.
4. **Decide:** Make an informed choice based on alerts, Nutri-Scores, and suggested alternatives.
